# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data trends using **MySQL**. The aim is to extract, analyze, and visualize key trends and insights related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Data Source and Cleaning
The data was sourced from **Our World in Data**. Using **Microsoft Excel**, I performed data cleaning by checking for:
- **Duplicate entries**
- **Null values**
- **Incorrect format**

## Method
1. **Data Import**: I imported the cleaned data into a MySQL schema.
2. **Querying Data**: I wrote queries to extract the necessary columns for analysis.

## Insights
From the analysis, I was able to uncover critical information that can assist in making data-driven decisions, such as:
- **Country with the highest number of deaths**
- **Country with the highest number of infections**
- **Country with the lowest number of deaths**
- **Country with the lowest number of infections**

These insights are crucial for understanding the impact of COVID-19 globally and can help in policy-making and resource allocation.
